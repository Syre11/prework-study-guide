        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Used to stylize the web app</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>h1,h2,h3... are headers. The lower the number, the larger the size. (Ex/ h1=Main header(Prework Study Guide), h2=2nd header (HTML,CSS,Git,JavaScript)</li>
          <li><h3>22-Sep-22</h3></li>
          <li>.xxx is to identify classes.   #xxx is to identify id's. id is more specific than class</li>
          <li>want to link stylesheet in the head. they need to be before any of the content shows up</li>
          <li>call multiple classes by putting class="class1 class2" --- you CANNOT call multiple id's</li>
          <li>naming your classes and id's is important for organization</li>
          <li><h4>use your context clues (look at other html/css files to see what to do</h4></li>
          <li>how to link to stylesheet: link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css"</li>
          <li>the later man wins. if you have a later selector it will override ones before it, unless it's more specific (an id can keep it's power if the override to follow is just a class)</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_specificity.asp">CSS Specificity:</a></li>
          <li>default font size is 16px</li>
          <li><h3>26-Sep-22</h3></li>
          <li>* is the universal selector</li>
          <li>start by setting default things (universal selector, all headers, individual headers, paragraphs, etc... just do before classes and id's)</li>
          <li>use rem for sizing things like font and margin, this is relative to the universal size. (ex. uni font is 16px. 2rem=32px)</li>
          <li>"margin: 0 auto;" centers block level elements</li>
          <li>content-box = set width + padding in addition. border-box = set width, will not extend beyong set width... box-sizing: border-box; is typical to be in the universal  section</li>
          <li>style widest screen first (ex. normal, tablets, big phones, little phones)</li>

          <li>box-shadow, border-radius, border-top-right-radius</li>
          <li>sometimes need to use CSS reset - find a premade reset.css sheet. tag it before the actual style sheet</li>
          <li><h3>29-Sep-22</h3></li>
          <li><strong>Selectors</strong></a></li>
          <li>pseudo elements allow you to style specific parts of elements. (::before and ::after are the most common) (:hover is a pseudo class, ::after is a pseudo element)</li>
          <li>changing position changes if something is in the flow or not. Absolute=I wanna position myself with my nearest positioned parent as my reference point, Relative=change my position. in order to contain something wihtin something, parent needs to be relative, child would be absolute</li>
          <li>This is called a data attribute: data- prefix (used like a class or id) (ex. data-descr="wait for it" data-john="here's the kicker" <strong>data-donut"lol"</strong></li>
          <li>the data- tag is like a custom selector creator</li>
          <li>Wireframing - "well I gotta create a webpage but I don't know where to start, by I need to do something" It's about form. No actual content</li>
          <li>create custom variables using "--xxx blue", this way if you need to change the theme of a whole page you just have to change the color in one spot. call it with var(--xxx). Can use with anything... colors, links, images.</li>

          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>JS lives within &lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</li>
          <li>Hint: name variables so the data type is obvious (ex. var isLunchTime = true... "isLunchTime" implies the output would be yes or no)</li>
          <li><h3>06-Oct-22</h3></li>
          <li>Scope isthe "visibility" of something (ex. everyone in seattle can see the sun set at 7pm, not everyone in seattle can see the space needle at that same time.)</li>
          <li>"you should avoid putting variables in global space" Fine to use with a small program</li>
          <li>EXPRESSIONS OUTPUT A VALUE: a+b, 3+5, 12 === "12", these are expressions. But they don't go anywhere, so you have to put it in a function or if or console.log. Or assign it to a variable</li>
          <li><strong>Removing things from arrays:</strong> yourVariable.unshift(), etc.<img class="images" src="./assets/pushpop.jpg" alt="PushPop"></li>
          <li>constants are often all caps (ex. Rock paper scissors game: var OPTIONS = ["R", "P". "S"])</li>
          <li>this.name is like saying my.name. you can pull something from within the object it's inside</li>
          <li>this refers to the parent object</li>
          <li>this, when put outside of an object refers to the window as a whole. The window is exactly what you think, it's the window that contains objects, which is everything in the code.</li>
