# Prework Study Guide Webpage


## Description

This Webpage is a way to keep notes from my Coding Bootcamp class at UW. This was built to be able to store all my notes in a central location. This keeps all my notes organized and easy to navigate. I learned about the basics of HTML, CSS, JS, and Git/GitHub. I also learned how to apply my Developer mindset and learned how to debug.

## Installation

## Usage

Notes can be added in the html index as unordered list items under each section respectively. If you open the DevTools console you can see JS running. It will list the topics learned and will randomly select a topic for you to study first.
